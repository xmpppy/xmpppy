 This is a set of modules providing functionality for writing
 xmpp-compliant clients, servers and/or components/transports in python.

 This library was initially designed as a "rework" of the jabberpy library
 but has become a separate product.
 .
 Unlike jabberpy it is distributed under the terms of GPL.
